## Installation

npm install openchemlib react-ocl
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { SmilesSvgRenderer } from 'react-ocl';

function MyComponent() {
  return <SmilesSvgRenderer smiles="COCCOOOCO" />;
}
```

## Which version of the library should I use?

This library is available in three versions, like openchemlib: `react-ocl/minimal`
(also available as `react-ocl`), `react-ocl/core` and `react-ocl/full`.

- If you only use the SvgRenderer component, you can choose any version, minimal
  being the smallest one.
- If you want to use the StructureEditor component, you must import `react-ocl/full`.
- If you are writing a library and want to allow your consumer to provide the OCL
  version for rendering, you must import `react-ocl/base`.
